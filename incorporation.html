              Delaware corporate law is THE body of corporate statutory and case law with which the greatest number of
              lawyers and investors are familiar. With years and years of corporate cases in Delaware the majority of
              players have greater confidence in how Delaware courts will address a wide range of business or governance
              disputes. Companies, VCs, lawyers can be sure what to expect from Delaware corporate law and that is a
              great advantage of forming your company in the state.
            </p>
            <p class="description__content">
              Clarity and predictability is definitely a win but let’s not forget about tax benefits that the state
              offers. According to Delaware tax law the state doesn't impose income tax on corporations registered in
              the state which don't do business in the state. Besides, shareholders not residing in Delaware don’t have
              to pay tax on shares in the state.
            </p>
            <p class="description__content">
              Combining the robustness of Delaware corporate law and tax benefits, Delaware is considered THE state for
              Corporations.
            </p>
            <p class="description__content">
              Now that we’ve cleared out why Corporation and Why Delaware we will go through the most essential steps of
              forming and protecting your company. We will share details on how to register a company, open a bank
              account, issue and buy your own shares, protect your business, fundraise and hire employees.

              Corporate minutes are required for all Delaware corporations by law. Falling behind on keeping and

              or actions by unanimous consent from any special or annual meetings of the corporation's shareholders and
